  A command line application that creates a professional README.md file

  ## Installation
  You must have Node.js downloaded, with “inquirer” listed under dependencies in a package.json file, and a node_modules file. Both the package.json and the node_modules must be in the same folder as the index.js file that contains the javascript file with the readme generator.
